# discordify
*A single-server focused music bot for Discord.* See the [help command](https://github.com/kuff/discordify/blob/master/FEATURES.jpg) for a list of all available commands.

## Installation
You are of course free to use this software however you like, as per the MIT license. Following is a short tutorial on how to spin up your own instance of the bot.
however, in order to run, the bot requires some credentials - more specifically a **Discord bot token** as well as the **id** of the bot user and a **YouTube api key**.

1.  A **Discord bot token** is optained by creating a new app on the [Discord app dashboard](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) and then registering the app as a Bot User.
2.  The **id** of the bot user can then also be copy-pasted from the Discord app dashboard.
3.  A **YouTube API v3 key** can be optained for free by logging in to the [Google API Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis) and registering a new project. After this, YouTube API v3 can be found under the "Library" tab on the left hand side, where you can choose to generate a new api key.

Hold on to this information, as it will become relevant in a minute. Now, for the actual installation process. This will be detailed using the command line on an *Ubuntu 16.04* machine, even though the code should be able to run in any environment that supports [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). Along with *NodeJS*, this guide also assumes that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

1.  Start by navigating to a suitable place for the bot source files to be installed.
2.  Next download the bot source files with `git clone https://github.com/kuff/discordify.git` and enter the directory by typing in `cd discordify`.
3.  Now, install [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) with `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`. This is needed for streaming audio over Discord voice chat.
4.  Next up, install the bot dependencies with `npm i`.
5.  Now those credentials from earlier come into play. Start by creating a config.json file with `touch config.json` and open it in your favorite text editor.
6.  Then copy-paste the information gathered earlier, structured the following way:

```
{
    "token": "discord_bot_token_goes_here",
    "self_id": "discord_bot_id_goes_here",
    "youtube_api_key": "youtube_api_key_goes_here"
}
```
7.  After typing in your information and saving the file you should be all set. The bot also ships with built in automated tests that can be run with `npm test` - if they pass you should be all set! The tests are fairly bandwidth intensive and if they fail due to a timeout it should be an indication that your bandwidth is less than ideal for streaming music through the Discord API. I also recommend hosting the bot on a machine with a dedicated CPU, as my personal experience is that a vCPU is not enough since audio encoding can be pretty demanding.
8.  Now, invite the bot to you Discord server by visiting the following link, substituting "BOT_ID_GOES_HERE" with your own bot id: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=BOT_ID_GOES_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=0.
9.  Finally, spin up the bot with `npm start`. However, for long term program execution you should look into [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/).

## Setup

Under the main directory there's a **settings.json** file where you can tweak a few things to your liking:
```
{
    "prefix": ".",
    "embed_color": 923430,
    "memory_size": 5,
    "default_volume": 0.07,
    "audio_passes": 2
}
````
1.  The **prefix** is the special character(s) that the bot should react on, meaning the one you put in front of a command keyword when you want the bot to do something specific, e.g. `.play a song`or `.pause`. As a result, I recommend that this be a special character, ensuring the bot is not invoked by mistake!
2.  The **embed_color** is the color code for the embeds, more specifically the think vertical strip of solid color on the left hand side of the Discord embeds. I recommend keeping this a darker color and have it match the pofile picture of you bot.
3.  The **memory_size** parameter is how many previously played songs the bot should remember. This is invoked with the `.replay` command and when autoplaying and I do not recommend keeping it shorter than five.
4.  **default_volume** is the volume used for playback when the bot starts playing. During playback the volume can then be changed with `.volume`, but is then reset once playback ends. You should probably not change this.
5.  **audio_passes** dictates how many passes the audio encoder takes through the data, before sending it off to the Discord API. This is useful to prevent stutter during playback but will also impact performance on higher values, and as a result should probably not be changed!
